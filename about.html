          <h1>Inspired By Grape Picking</h1>
            <div class="line">_</div>
          <h2>1944</h2>
          <section class="content">
            <p>Cosmo Anthony Johnson owned and operated a small winery in Ashtabula, Ohio, serving the local area with wine and fresh pressed juice. As wine consumption in America declined, and beer came into favor, he closed the winery and went to work for the New York Central Railroad.
            </p>
            <p>In 1957, having his fill of working for someone else, he started a small railroad construction company. He asked his son and daughter-in-law, Larry & Ida, to join the company in 1962. By the mid 70's, Larry's sons and nephews began working in the railroad industry.
            </p>
            <p>In 1974, on the way back from work, Cosmo directed his grandson Larry Jr. to jump the fence surrounding the Burkholder farm and pick some fresh grapes. This small event brought the dream of this winery to our family.

          <h1>Buying The Grape Farm</h1>
            <div class="line">_</div>
          <h2>1991</h2>
          <section class="content">
            <p>Larry Jr. read in the paper that a grape farm was being auctioned. He recognized it as the same farmland where he had jumped the fence to grab a cluster of grapes with his grandfather. The family gathered at the auction and with one giant leap of faith bought the farm. Since 2002 the dream of owning a winery has become Larry Jr's. and his wife Kim's reality. This event tied the generations back together.
            </p>
            <p>"We dedicate, in our grandfather's memory, Off the Vine. Just as important and influential in our families' lives are our parents, Larry & Ida Laurello. They continue to own and operate Delta Railroad Construction, Inc. Both have been instrumental in bringing about the dream of the winery." They periodically sip wine on the weekends with family & friends.
